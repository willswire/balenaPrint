# balenaPrint

This project provides an easy way of running CUPS/Avahi on a balenaOS-provisioned Raspberry Pi 3 B/B+. CUPS is a modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems which allows computers to act as a print server, in this case enabling AirPrint capability for legacy printers.

The CUPS management console is available through the Device Public URL within the balenaCloud control panel. The customized cupsd.conf file in this repo allows public access for admin configuration settings.

## Getting started

The folks at balena have created [this guide](https://www.balena.io/blog/wifi-enable-usb-printers-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-share-it-over-your-network/) to help people get started with using balena-cups. If you're familiar with balenaCloud and want an even faster way to get started, click here:
